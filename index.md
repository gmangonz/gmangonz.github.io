# About Me

A recent M.S. Electrical Engineering graduate from Northeastern University concentrating in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Algorithms. I completed my B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Rice University, giving me a strong cross‑disciplinary foundation.

I’m energized by problems that create real‑world impact in medical imaging, surgical robotics, self‑driving, defense, and broader automation. Curiosity drives me as I’m always exploring new techniques in AI, reinforcement learning, and data science.
