## Experience Summary

My research and project work center on applying deep learning–driven computer vision to robotics and intelligent, autonomous systems. This has given me hands‑on experience building vision pipelines, training models in PyTorch and TensorFlow, and optimizing deployments with tools such as TensorRT for real‑time performance. My primary work has centered around pose estimation, instance segmentation for 3D reconstruction, SLAM based approaches for camera tracking for scene reconstruction, and deployment to embedded devices and FPGAs with ONNX, TensorRT and VART.
